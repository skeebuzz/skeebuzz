# Our Project Methodology 

As a collective, members will come together to work on a project as a team. Projects go 
through a three-step process:

1. **Ideation** - Members propose and evaluate potential ideas, and one gets selected 
   when it gains enough interest and commitment from members.
1. **Validation** - The idea goes through validation. The idea is to find customers that
   will be willing to pay for the idea. This will typically involve taking in a certain
   number of pre-orders.
1. **Build** - If the team is satisfied that the idea has been validated (e.g. if the 
   pre-order target was hit), then the project is green-lighted and building starts.
